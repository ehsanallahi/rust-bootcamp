- **User Interface**: Clear and intuitive text-based user interface using the `dialoguer` crate.

## About Me

I am a frontend developer who loves crafting user-friendly websites using JavaScript, TypeScript, and React JS / NEXT JS. I'm all about creating cool stuff online and constantly learning new things. Lately, I've been really curious about Web3 and blockchain development - I believe they're the future, and I'm eager to be a part of it!

## Vision

The vision for this project is to provide a simple yet effective inventory management solution for small retail stores, leveraging the power of Rust's performance, safety, and concurrency features. Future enhancements may include support for more advanced features such as data persistence, multi-user access, and integration with other systems.
